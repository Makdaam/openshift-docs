//openshift-aro 3.11 specific

This section describes all azure resources used to build a cluster.

== Virtual Machine Scale Sets

=== ss-masters
A scale set of 3 virtual machines used for core services.
An Etcd daemon, the OpenShift API Server, and the OpenShift Controller are
among the core services that are hosted on masters.
The ARO Sync Pod also runs on one of the Master Virtual Machines.

=== ss-infra-TIMESTAMP
A scale set of 3 virtual machines used for running infrastructure pods.
Among other services running here are:

- the docker registry
- routers for applications running on openshift
- OpenShift web console
- template service broker
- cluster monitoring Prometheus (used by ARO SREs to monitor cluster health)

=== ss-compute-TIMESTAMP
A scale set of virtual machines used by customers' pods. All customer
application pods and build pods are scheduled on nodes within this scale set.
The number of virtual machines can be adjusted by the customer.

== Disks
All *kubernetes-dynamic-pvc-&#42;* Disks are attached to their respective
Virtual Machine for azure-disk class PVs.
Please note that PVs are not backed up or replicated and shouldn't be used
for long term storage.

== Public IP addresses

=== ip-apiserver
Used for OpenShift API and Web Console access, points to the *lb-apiserver*.
Name resolution is described in the xref:#dns-configuration[DNS configuration] section below.

=== ip-outbound
Used for outbound traffic from customers' and infrastructure pods.
It's configured in the *kubernetes* load balancer.

=== kubernetes-&#42;
Used for inbound traffic to applications running in the customers' namespace.
It's configured in the *kubernetes* load balancer.

== Load Balancers
- *lb-apiserver* - As described in the IP Addresses section and is used for API access.
- *kubernetes* - Used for all other Internet traffic:
connections inbound to customers' services running on the cluster and
connections outbound from customers' pods.

== Network security groups

=== nsg-master
Applied to master nodes. Allows API access as well as SSH management access
by ARO backend management systems.

=== nsg-worker
Applied to infra and compute nodes. Allows access to the services exposed
via the *kubernetes* load balancer.


[[dns-configuration]]
== DNS configuration
There are two DNS zones which together provide the following names:
*openshift.ID.REGION.azmosa.io* DNS name which points to the *ip-apiserver*
IP address for API access and the *&#42;.apps.ID.REGION.azmosa.io* alias
which points (via CNAME) to the *kubernetes-&#42;* IP address for inbound
requests to customers' services.

== Key Vault
Key vault *kv-&#42;* stores the keys and certificates related to the cluster.

== Storage Accounts

=== sacfg
The account beginning with *sacfg* stores master node startup config, scaleset
hashes, and etcd backups.

=== sareg
Account *sareg* is the docker registry storage for customer cluster applications.

=== safil
Account *safil* stores data for PVs with the azure-file storage class.

== Pods
There are some additional management pods running in an Azure Red Hat OpenShift
cluster. This section summarizes their purpose.

=== Sync pod
The Sync Pod runs on a single master node. The sync pod deployment settings
ensure there's one instance running at all times.
Its role is to make sure that all
managed OpenShift resources are synchronized with the desired values.

=== Customer Admin controller
This controller synchronizes the contents of the designated Azure Active
Directory group to the cluster RBAC customer-admin group. Also makes sure all
required RBAC roles are granted on the customer created namespaces.

=== Monitoring related
Cluster Monitoring Prometheus gathers monitoring data for Azure Red Hat
OpenShift site reliability engineering teams.
This internal prometheus is not directly available to the customers,
but the data it gathers is exposed over Azure Monitoring Workspaces.
